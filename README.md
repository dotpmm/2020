# 2020
A simple .py script to put the well known [202020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10391416/) rule into practice

# How it works

- Uses the `tkinter` python library to display a fullscreen background with a simple text for 20sec.
- Uses the `threading` feature to keep the script alive even when focused on tkinter GUI.
